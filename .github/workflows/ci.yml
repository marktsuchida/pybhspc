  # Unfortunately there is no easy way to run the tests on GitHub Actions
  # because spcm64.dll fails to load when the drivers are not installed (even
  # with cvirte.dll provided, the DLL initialization routine fails).
  # Documentation cannot be built for the same reason. We can, however,
  # automate the build itself, which does not load the DLL.
